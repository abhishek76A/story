Matra, 55, lives in a camp for displaced people in north-west Syria. Gardening reminds her of her village, and it helps her to forget her sorrow, fears and the conflict unfolding around her. In the winter, the smell of flowers from her garden gives her neighbours in the camp a much-needed respite from the smell of coal.

Camps rarely include gardens or gardening spaces, as they are only temporary shelters until displaced people can return home. However, there is a deep connection between many regional communities and creating gardens; people often take up gardening as a way to exercise some control over their immediate surroundings at a time when they seem to have lost control over broader events.
